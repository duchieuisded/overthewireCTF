**LV2**

On this level, we need to find password in a file '-'. As usual we list the files and open it

At here, the file isn't open correctly since '-' are require user to enter an option to execute program(eg: -l, -p...)

To fix this, we simply add a **./** before the filename

As you can see, the password has been founded. Now we exit current level and continue to Level 3

Now we need to get the password to login Level 1 from readme file. First we list the file that exists, we will see a file
name 'readme'. Open the file and we'll see the text "The password you are looking for is" appeared. A string of characters is 
the password we need to find.

After we found the password, we exit the program and continue login to Level 1
